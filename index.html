  <h2>Why is Alyssa taking this class?</h2>

  <p>I have enrolled in this class to become a UX Designer.  Four years ago I started to explore transferring my art skills to the tech industry.</p>

  <p>I enrolled in evening classes at a community college near the San Francisco Bay Area, taking both Web Design and Game Design classes.  It was during these classes I was first introduced to computer programming.</p>

  <p>One day in class, my professor was walking past my desk and asked what I was doing.  "I'm just tweaking the code," I replied.  He looked at me with a strange expression and said, "You know, it is unusual for an artist to have no fear about diving into code.  You should consider being a programmer.  The industry needs programmers who a visual talents."</p>

  <p>Thus, began my journey to becoming a computer programmer.</p>

  <h2>Early Achievements</h2

    <p>Below are four projects I completed during my evening classes.</p>

    <p>My first website using Dreamweaver as a  developer tool. <a href="http://192.254.232.24/~alyssaad/131a/index.html" target="_blank"><span class="redText">Fabric Design Portfolio</span> </a></p>  

   <p>My second website I "hard-coded" in HTML.  <a href="Cake/Index.html" target="_blank"><span class="redText">Chocolate Cake</span></a></p>

    <p>My first mobile website using HTML and PhoneGap as a developer tool.<a href="http://192.254.232.24/~alyssaad/134a/index.html" target="_blank"><span class="redText">  Mobile Portfolio</span></a></p>

    <p>And finally, my first computer game using Unity as a developer tool.  It is a prototype game for children, intended to teach them about catepillars.  I have not learned how to upload this game to a site to have it playable, so stay tuned.</p>

  <h2>Concerns</h2>
  <p>The fact that I will be using a <strong>PC </strong>instead of a MAC for this class has me a little concerned.  I am comfortable working in either environment, but   <span class="blueText">my PC doesn't seem to want to connect to the school's wifi.</span>
   
  
  <p>Currently, playing <strong>"catch-up"</strong> is my main focus, <span class="blueText">as I missed the first day of class.</span>  I have managed to complete the PreCourse Assignment.</p>

  <p>I have not completed the <strong>survey "pre-test".</strong></p>
